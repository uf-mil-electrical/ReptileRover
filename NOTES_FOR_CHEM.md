### metals vs non-metals

trends between metals and non-metals

METALS:
- larger atomic size
- lower $Z_{eff}$
- lower IE
- less negative EA

NON-METALS:
- smaller atomic size
- Higher $Z_{eff}$
- Higer IE
- more negative EA

### types of bonding

we see ionic bonding when a metal and a non-metal bond

this bond involves the transfer of 1 or more electrons

```
metal tends to lose 1 electron and non-metal tends to gain one electron
```

we see COVALENT bonding when a non-metal and a non-metal bond together

this bond involves the sharing of electrons between two non-metals

```
both non-metals feel as if they simply have another electron
```

METALIC bonding involves electron pooling and is when metals bond to other metals

### lewis electon dot-symbols

note the A-group number, which gives the number of electrons

place one dot a time on each of the four sides of the element symbol

we use lewis symbols to determine how each of the elements reacts in bonding

#### metal lewis

in a metal, the electron dots that we draw are the electrons that the metal will lose 

to become a cation

#### non-metal lewis

in a non-metal, the number of unpaied dots equals

the number of electrons the atom gains to form an anion (when ionic)

or the number it shares to form covalent bonds

### octet rule

when an atom bonds it will lose, gain, or share electrons st it's outer shell is filled with 8 electrons

(only 2 for H and Li)

they will do their best to get to noble gas configuration

ionic bonding = redox reaction

### born haber cycles for ions

when ions bond together to and form bonds energy is released

### lattice energy

energy required to seperate 1 mol of an ionic solid into gaseous ions

this is the measure of strength of an ionic bond

it's magnitude depends on ionic size, ionic charge, and ionic arrangement

its positve

#### columbs law says

$\triangle H = \frac{C_1 C_2}{r_1 +R_2}$

so we just have to think in charge and radii to see how lattice energy would change

### trends in lattice energy

it's affected by ionic size and ionic charge

bigger ion means smaller lattice energy, so lattice energy increases down a period but decreases down a group

### more trends

ionic compounds are hard ribid and brittle

they have high metling points

do not conduct elect in the solid state

melted or dissolved they will conduct

#### cool ting

melting points and boiling points are related to lattice energy
